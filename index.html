Worked on multiple small projects simultaneously around fan economy, creator economy, vtubing and eventually joined as founding advisor at Hytopia which is building a modern UGC platform like Roblox/Minecraft.

This was an inverse facebook model where studios would spend money to acquire relevant cohorts of users and a large part of the value capture (about 70%) would be distributed back to players who completed tasks. Led investments, strategy and business for them and helped grow it from 0 to $2.5mn ARR.

Started a gaming guild where we built a community of 50K active gamers in Phillipines and India and over ~$1mn in AUM. We would buy assets in web3 games and generate yield on them by renting them out to gamers from developing economies in South East Asia like Phillipines, Vietnam etc who would play games by renting these assets from us. (most of the games were gated so you required assets to play the game). They would generate earnings which would be distributed between guild and player in 50-50 ratio. We helped over 10k gamers earn over $500k in 6 months.</div>
